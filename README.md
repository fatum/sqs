# Sqs

This is very simple, pure thread-based implementation of message processor without hard dependencies (only aws, thread, thread_safe gems are used).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sqs', github: 'fatum/sqs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

```ruby
worker = Sqs::Worker.new(
  queue: "queue",
  worker_size: 1,
  poller_size: 1
)

worker.execute do |message|
  p message.body

  sleep 1
end
```
